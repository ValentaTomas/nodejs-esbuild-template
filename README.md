# Node.js Esbuild Template

## Setup
Use **Node.js 16.2.0** when developing code in this repository.
> **_NOTE:_** Everything will probably work even with Node.js 14, but it's better to keep the same versions.

Run the following command after you clone the repo to **install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development
Run the following command to start a **local server that reloads** when you change code or GraphQL schema:
```bash
npm run watch
```

## Release
